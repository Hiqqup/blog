        Hi I'm hiqqup and I like working on visuals.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am really passionate about all things graphics programming, design and art.
        I built this website in order to write some technical blog posts to share my journey in graphics
        as well as shed some light on what projects I am working on. I hope among the posts people might
        find helpful insights and tips when building something similar.
    </p>
